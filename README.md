## What is Analog clock ?

- An analog clock is a classic timekeeping device characterized by a circular face with numbers or markers around its edge, typically representing the hours from 1 to 12. The clock face is the focal point, with hands rotating around a central point to indicate time.
- The hour hand is shorter and moves slowly around the clock, completing one full rotation every 12 hours. The minute hand is longer and moves more quickly, completing one rotation every 60 minutes. Some clocks also have a second hand, a thin, delicate hand that moves 
  in a continuous or ticking motion, completing a full circle every 60 seconds.
- The clock is encased in a protective frame, which can be made from various materials like wood, metal, or plastic, depending on the style. The design of analog clocks can range from simple and functional to ornate and decorative, making them both a practical tool and a piece of art or decoration.

Analog clocks are found in various settings, including homes, offices, schools, and public spaces, offering a timeless way to tell time with both elegance and simplicity.

# What is  Asynchronous Programming?

- Asynchronous programming is a process that allows an application to run a second set of instructions while focusing on its primary or basic process.
- Asynchronous programming has several benefits, including improved application performance, wide application to different coding languages, and better user experience.

# What is Future Class ?

- In Dart, a Future represents a value that may not be available yet. It encapsulates an asynchronous operation and provides a way to handle the result or error when it becomes available.

# What is Duration class & Future.delayed() constructor with Example ?
## Duration Class

The Duration class in Dart represents a span of time, such as 5 seconds or 3 minutes. It is commonly used to specify time intervals.

Future.delayed() Constructor
The Future.delayed() constructor creates a future that completes after a specified duration. It's useful for simulating delays in asynchronous operations.


# What is Recursion ?

## Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It is useful for tasks that can be divided into similar subtasks, like traversing data structures or solving mathematical problems.

# What is Timer class?

## Timer Class

The Timer class in Dart is used to create a timer that runs a function after a specified duration or repeatedly at specified intervals. It's useful for tasks like scheduling events or creating delays.

# What is Timer.periodic?

## Timer.periodic

The Timer.periodic constructor in Dart creates a timer that repeatedly runs a function at specified intervals. It's useful for executing a task at regular intervals, like updating a UI or polling for data.
