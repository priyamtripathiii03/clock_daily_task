# What is  Asynchronous Programming?

- Asynchronous programming is a process that allows an application to run a second set of instructions while focusing on its primary or basic process.
- Asynchronous programming has several benefits, including improved application performance, wide application to different coding languages, and better user experience.

# What is Future Class ?

- In Dart, a Future represents a value that may not be available yet. It encapsulates an asynchronous operation and provides a way to handle the result or error when it becomes available.

# What is Duration class & Future.delayed() constructor with Example ?
## Duration Class

The Duration class in Dart represents a span of time, such as 5 seconds or 3 minutes. It is commonly used to specify time intervals.

Future.delayed() Constructor
The Future.delayed() constructor creates a future that completes after a specified duration. It's useful for simulating delays in asynchronous operations.


# What is Recursion ?

## Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It is useful for tasks that can be divided into similar subtasks, like traversing data structures or solving mathematical problems.
